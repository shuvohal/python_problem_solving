#Positive Number Sum: Write a Python program that takes positive numbers as input until a negative number is entered. Then, calculate and print the sum of all positive numbers entered. Use a `while` loop and `break` to exit the loop when a negative number is encountered.

total = 0

while True:
    num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

    if num < 0:
        break

    total += num

print("Sum of positive numbers:", total)
