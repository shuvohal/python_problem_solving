#Tuple Membership Test: Write a Python program that takes an element as input and checks if it exists in a given tuple.
t = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

element = int(input("Enter element to search: "))

if element in t:
    print("Element exists in the tuple")
else:
    print("Element does not exist in the tuple")
